## 📌 Project Overview

The tech industry is known for its innovation, but often overlooked is the mental well-being of the professionals behind that innovation. This project dives into survey data from tech employees to explore trends, challenges, and opportunities for improving mental health support in the workplace.

---

## 📊 Objectives

- Analyze mental health awareness, treatment, and perception in tech workplaces.
- Identify factors contributing to positive or negative mental health outcomes.
- Explore correlations between workplace support and mental health disclosure.
- Provide insights for companies and professionals to foster better mental health environments.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked for null values and imbalanced classes
- Cleaned inconsistent entries (e.g., gender normalization)
- Visualized age distribution, treatment seeking behavior, company support
- Explored:
  - How remote work affects mental health
  - Correlation between family history and mental health issues
  - Workplace support vs. willingness to seek treatment
